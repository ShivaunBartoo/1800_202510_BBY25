# Likemind

## Overview
Likemind is a web application designed to help individuals form relationships within unfamiliar social groups by matching them with like-minded peers based on shared interests and values. The app surveys users to create detailed profiles, then introduces them to others within the same group who have similar responses. Users can also create and administer groups, such as university cohorts or workplace communities, and invite their peers to join.

This project was inspired by our own experiences of stepping into a classroom on the first day of school without knowing anyone. We aim to ease the anxiety of these situations by helping users build connections more quickly and naturally in new environments.

Likemind also seeks to prevent missed connections in medium-sized groups (ranging from several dozen to several hundred people). In these environments, two like-minded individuals might spend years crossing paths without ever properly meeting. Our goal is to facilitate that first meaningful connection.

Developed for the COMP-1800 course, applying User-Centred Design practices, agile project management processes, and Firebase backend services.

## Limitations and Future Work
### Limitations

Example:
- Currently, the app only supports city-based weather searches.
- Limited to basic weather parameters like temperature, humidity, and conditions.
- The user interface can be further enhanced for accessibility.

### Future Work

Example: 
- Add support for location-based weather detection using GPS.
- Implement additional weather parameters like wind speed and UV index.
- Create a dark mode for better usability in low-light conditions.
- Integrate user accounts for saving favorite locations.
